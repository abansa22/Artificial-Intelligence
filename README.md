# Artificial-Intelligence

Started with an attempt to define what is intelligence, and relate it to the notion
of rationality. Then explained agent architectures and kinds of
environments these agents can operate in. and related agent design with popular
applications of AI in object recognition, automated reasoning and robotics. 

Then explained the topic of search (planning), first in simple cases of goal-based
agents, then in more general settings. We will study uninformed search techniques,
informed A*, search in multi agent environments, and search in nondeterministic and
partially observable environments.

# Advanced Artificial-Intelligence

After planning and search I explored knowledge representation and reasoning
using, Propositional Logic, First Order Logic, Temporal Logic, Probability Theory, Fuzzy Logic.

Begin with review of autonomous agent architectures ad environment types, and go on to topics
of uncertainty reasoning, automated decision making, sequential planning in nondeterministic and
partially observable environments, go on to dynamic environments, multi-agent settings, and unknown
environments.

# AI MODELS
Implemented agents acting in a simulated environment, starting with the simple
reflex agent, and on to reflex agent with a state, goal based agent, a utility-based agent, a learning
agent, and an agent capable of dealing with other agents.


# Applied Artificial Intelligence

Demonstrating proven projects in each of the major applied AI techniques: Rule-based system, fuzzy logic rule-based system, a probabilistic reasoning system, an automated decision-making system, and a learning system and a deep language model.
