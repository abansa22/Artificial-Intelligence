# Advanced Artificial-Intelligence

We begin with review of autonomous agent architectures ad environment types, and go on to topics
of uncertainty reasoning, automated decision making, sequential planning in nondeterministic and
partially observable environments, go on to dynamic environments, multi-agent settings, and unknown
environments.

# AI MODELS
I implemented agents acting in a simulated Wumpus environment, starting with the simple
reflex agent, and on to reflex agent with a state, goal based agent, a utility-based agent, a learning
agent, and an agent capable of dealing with other agents.
