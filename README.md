# Artificial-Intelligence

Started with an attempt to define what is intelligence, and relate it to the notion
of rationality. Then explained agent architectures and kinds of
environments these agents can operate in. and related agent design with popular
applications of AI in object recognition, automated reasoning and robotics. 

Then explained the topic of search (planning), first in simple cases of goal-based
agents, then in more general settings. We will study uninformed search techniques,
informed A*, search in multi agent environments, and search in nondeterministic and
partially observable environments.

After planning and search we will explore knowledge representation and reasoning
using, first, predicate logic, and then first order logic.

# Advanced Artificial-Intelligence

We begin with review of autonomous agent architectures ad environment types, and go on to topics
of uncertainty reasoning, automated decision making, sequential planning in nondeterministic and
partially observable environments, go on to dynamic environments, multi-agent settings, and unknown
environments.

# AI MODELS
I implemented agents acting in a simulated Wumpus environment, starting with the simple
reflex agent, and on to reflex agent with a state, goal based agent, a utility-based agent, a learning
agent, and an agent capable of dealing with other agents.
